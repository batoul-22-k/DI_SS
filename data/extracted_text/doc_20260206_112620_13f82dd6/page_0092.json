Through this comprehensive training regimen, \nour model achieved outstanding results showing performance as in \nFigure 7.10, boasting a CER of only 3% on the test set and an Accuracy \nof 97%. These metrics underscore the model's robustness and accuracy \nin recognizing handwritten Arabic text, demonstrating its effectiveness \nin real-world applications.  \n \nThis final model represents a culmination of rigorous experimentation, \nmeticulous parameter tuning, and leveraging the power of transfer \nlearning. Its high accuracy and low error rate position it as a reliable tool \nfor applications requiring precise recognition of Arabic characters and \ntext, validating its capability as our definitive and highly effective model. \n \n \nFigure 7.10: ResNet50V2 Trained on Alphabet from KHATT Dataset \n",
