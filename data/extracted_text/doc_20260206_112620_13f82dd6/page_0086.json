Additionally, Figure 7.6  \ndepicting the CER and loss of the ResNet152 model throughout the \nepochs shows a noticeable decrease in error, particularly in the final \nepochs. \n \nModel \nValidation Loss Character Error Rate Accuracy\nVGG19 \n0.6 \n5.4% \n94.6% \nEfficientNetB1 0.78 \n7.3% \n92.7% \nResNet152 \n0.3 \n2.96% \n97.04% \nTable 2: Comparison Between CNN Architectures Performance \n \n",
