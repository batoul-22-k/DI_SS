The \nNadam optimizer parameters included 𝛃1=0.9, 𝛃2=0.999, and ε=1 x e-08. \nInitially tested on a dataset with a resolution of 32x32, that test resulted \nin a model with a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.62% corresponding to \n95.38% accuracy. Performance of the model is shown in Figure 7.8.  \n",
