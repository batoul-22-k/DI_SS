This approach utilizes knowledge gained from \nsolving one problem and applies it to a different but related problem, \ntypically resulting in improved learning efficiency and performance. In \nour case, after initially training ResNet50V2 on an Arabic Alphabet \nCharacter dataset consisting of 58,474 samples, we easily achieved a \n",
