This study, \nauthored by Ayman Saber Gad Mohammed, Ahmed Taha Ahmed Abd El \nRahim, and Khaled Abd El Salam from the Faculty of Engineering's \nElectrical Department, delves into cutting-edge deep learning \ntechniques for recognizing Arabic handwriting. By leveraging \nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Long Short-\nTerm Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, our method achieved outstanding \nresults, including a character error rate of roughly 2.96% and an \naccuracy rate of 97.04% on the KHATT dataset. These results \nsignificantly \nsurpass \ntraditional \napproaches, \nunderscoring \nour \nsubstantial contributions to the domain of Arabic handwriting \nrecognition. \n \n \n",
