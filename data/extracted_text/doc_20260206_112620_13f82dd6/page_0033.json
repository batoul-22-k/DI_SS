The infinite \nvariations necessitate a highly generalized model, making any small \namount of data completely impractical to work with. To recognize text \nin paragraphs, the process should involve preprocessing; starting with \nline segmentation to isolate individual lines of text, word segmentation \nto break down lines into “islands”, meaning words or sub-words, using \nspace detection algorithms.\n",
