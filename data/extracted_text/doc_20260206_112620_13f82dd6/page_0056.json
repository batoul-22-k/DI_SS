They are \ndistinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance \nwith image, speech, or audio signal inputs classifying and dealing with \nthem. The general layers of a CNN are: \n \n Convolutional layers & Pooling layers which are used for feature \nextraction of the images \n Fully connected (FC) layer which provides the output or the \nclassification \n \n \nFigure 4.11: Demonstration of CNN Layers and Architecture \n \n4.2.2.2 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) \n \n \nA recurrent neural network (RNN)[31] is a type of artificial neural \nnetwork which uses sequential data or time series data [64][65][66]. \nThese deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or \ntemporal problems, such as language translation, natural language \nprocessing (NLP), and speech recognition [67][68]. They are \ndistinguished by their “memory” as they take information from prior \ninputs to influence the current input and output. \n",
