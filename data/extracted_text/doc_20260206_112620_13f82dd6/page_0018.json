It refers to the \nmechanical or electronic translation of images of Handwritten \ncharacters or printed text into machine code without any variation. \n \nFigure 1.1 [12] shows types of OCR [13]. \n \n \nFigure 1.1: Types of character recognition \n \n1.1.2.1 \nArabic Printed and Handwritten OCR \n \nThe characters are written on paper or directly on a touch screen \nusing a pen or fingers. Printed OCR takes an image containing printed text \nas input and converts it into editable text. \n",
